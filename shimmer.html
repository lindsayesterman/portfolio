    <h2>Shimmer (YC S21)</h2>
    <p>Built React/Firebase mood tracker app, helped 100+ users record and visualize their mental health progress,
        helped plan H1 roadmap</p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>“It would be helpful if I felt like I was getting something tangible out of Shimmer. Although, I do recognize
        that that's typically not part of the mental health journey. Something I'm looking to do for myself is try
        to keep track, on a high-level, how my mental health is doing and what context/triggers might be resulting
        in changes to it. If there was a way for Shimmer to help me keep track of this, that would be a big problem
        solved!”</p>
    <p>Users with mental health struggles are attending weekly meetings, participating in self-care, and talking to
        multiple therapists, yet have no tangible evidence of their progress at Shimmer. After partaking in all of
        these activities, they wished there was some objective measure to show how far they’ve come. </p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>To help users better understand their mental well-being, I built a mood tracker app. Users can record their
        moods, enter what’s on their minds at the time, and view their mental health progress over the past week,
        month, and year.</p>
